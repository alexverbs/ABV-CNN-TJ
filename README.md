# Tom and Jerry Convolutional Neural Network

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow Keras, designed to classify images into four categories: Tom, Jerry, both, or neither.

## About the Model

The CNN is trained to identify whether Tom, Jerry, both characters, or neither appear in a given image. 

It currently achieves: 

93% training accuracy ðŸ˜Ž

80% testing accuracy, which suggests overfitting and presents an opportunity for improvement. ðŸ˜°

## Features

Image Classification: The model categorizes images into one of four classes (Tom, Jerry, both, or neither).

Consecutive Frame Detection: The program can detect how many consecutive frames contain both Tom and Jerry.

Performance Visualization: Visual graphs are included to monitor the model's accuracy and loss throughout the training process.
